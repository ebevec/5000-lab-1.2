abstract = {Advancing a new drug to market requires substantial investments in time as well as financial resources. Crucial bioactivities for drug candidates, including their efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and adverse effects, need to be investigated during drug development. With advancements in chemical synthesis and biological screening technologies over the past decade, a large amount of biological data points for millions of small molecules have been generated and are stored in various databases. These accumulated data, combined with new machine learning (ML) approaches, such as deep learning, have shown great potential to provide insights into relevant chemical structures to predict in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes, thereby advancing drug discovery and development in the big data era.}

abstract = {A key element in solving real-life data science problems is selecting the types of models to use. Tree ensemble models (such as XGBoost) are usually recommended for classification and regression problems with tabular data. However, several deep learning models for tabular data have recently been proposed, claiming to outperform XGBoost for some use cases. This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.}
